    <h3>JS review - week 4</h3>
    <p>Js variables must start with var const or let when declared. Const is 
        a constant and cannot be mutated, var is only localized inside functions otherwise it is global. let is local to its block.</p>
    <p>Code blocks in js are denoted by {}. js can be run in side script tags in an html file, linked in the src property of the script file, from the browser console or run using node in the command line </p>
    <p>basic data types inclued integers, floats, booleans,arrays, objects, strings, functions, null</p>

    <p>js opperators are similar to python with some exceptions</p>

    <ul>
        <li>increment ++</li>
        <li> decrement --</li>
        <li>loose comparison ==</li>
        <li>strict comparison ===</li>
        <li> not !</li>
        <li> and &&</li>
        <li>or ||</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>DOM and BOM</h4>

    <p>Browser Object Modle represents the window or tab. Document Object Model represents the web page. BOM accessable through window object. window has  document property. window object also has othe useful properties.</p>

    <p>The browser converts HTML docs into  a DOM whos structure is represented by a NODE tree. Nodes can be elements, attributess of elements or anythong that is part of the HTML doc. document.something serves as the entry point to the node tree </p>

    <p>DOM selectors are ues to access HTML elements in the document. Once we have accessed an element we can change things about it dynamically throught js by accessing its properties</p>
    <p>we can also create new elements using docment.createElement('element') The created elements must be .append ed to their parent element before they will show up on the page</p>
